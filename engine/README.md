# TODO

1. camera 
2. put errors in logs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53579283/directx-11-debug-layer-capture-error-strings
3. deferred rendering
4. maybe factor so i can switch the rendering type on the fly? (think about this, but need not execute if too complex for me rn)
5. model loading
6. cmake shader autocopy on shader changes/compile shaders using external compiler?
