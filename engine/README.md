# TODO

1. deferred rendering
2. better mesh loading with gltf importer
3. Texture class
4. replace cmake data copying in favour of passing the data directory to exe
5. move imgui stuff out of renderer?
6. maybe factor so i can switch the rendering type on the fly? (think about this, but need not execute if too complex for me rn)
7. cmake shader autocopy on shader changes/compile shaders using external compiler?
8. imgui graphing extension
9. tracy profiler integration
10. shader compiler tool, compiles hlsl shader files and saves bytecode
