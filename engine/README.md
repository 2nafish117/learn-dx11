3. cmd line parsing
4. cmd line option for data directory
5. replace cmake data copying in favour of passing the data directory to exe
6. move imgui stuff out of renderer?
7. maybe factor so i can switch the rendering type on the fly? (think about this, but need not execute if too complex for me rn)
